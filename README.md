Instagram Challenge
===================

![alt text](http://i.imgur.com/85xEGGp.png "Instagrails")

##Done
* Users have accounts
* Users can post pictures
* Users have a profile
* Pictures have filters
* Pictures have comments

##To do
* Implement image filtering on the server side rather than client side. At the moment only the raw image is saved and a JS filter applied every time it is loaded.
* Associate comments with a user through an image.
* Implement 'liking' functionality.

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need users who can post pictures, write comments on pictures and like a picture. It will need to look like the instagrams website or better. 

Breakdown of models:
- User
- Post
- Comment/description
- Like

Bonus if you can add filters :P
